# TensorFlow Community Meetings

[TensorFlow SIGs](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/tree/master/sigs)
and other groups hold regular meetings via videoconference. Usually 
you will find these added to your calendar after you join the Google Group relevant
to the SIG or community group.

There is also a master calendar listing all community meetings:
