# SIG Micro - TensorFlow Embedded Group

## Objective

For discussion and collaborations around running TensorFlow models on microcontrollers, DSPs, and other highly-resource constrained embedded devices. There are no hard rules about what counts as embedded, but this group concentrates on the challenges of running on devices that may only have hundreds or even tens of kilobytes of memory and storage.

## Membership

We welcome everyone involved in machine learning in embedded environments to join the group! To participate, request an invitation to join the mailing list.

Archives of the mailing list will be publicly available.
