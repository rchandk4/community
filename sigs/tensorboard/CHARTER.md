# SIG TensorBoard

## Objective

To facilitate code contribution and plugin development for the TensorBoard
project.

## Membership

Everyone involved in developing with TensorBoard is welcome to participate in
our [GitHub community](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard). The SIG
mailing list exists to facilitate conversations between certain stakeholders.
While the contents of this list are publicly available for maximum transparency,
we curate posting privileges to ensure each group of stakeholders has exactly
one voice. The TensorBoard team reserves the right to exercise good judgement in
determining the boundaries of stakeholding.

Archives of the mailing list are publicly accessible.
